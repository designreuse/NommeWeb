We are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with privacy and the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through this website, the related mobile sites and mobile application(s), and selected other domains (the "Sites"). Except as indicated below, this Privacy Policy does not address the collection, use or disclosure of information by any of our affiliates or by other third parties on any websites other than the Sites. As used in this Agreement, "Nomme," "we," "us," and "our" shall mean Meta-universe Technology Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
<br><br>
By accessing and/or using the Sites, you agree to all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Sites. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and without prior notice. If we make a change to this Privacy Policy, it will be effective as soon as we post it, and the most current version of this Privacy Policy will always be posted under the Privacy Policy tab of the Nomme.ca website. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you. You agree that you will check out this Privacy Policy periodically. By continuing to access and/or use the Sites after we make changes to this Privacy Policy, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy. You agree that if you do not agree to the new terms of the Privacy Policy, you will stop using the Sites.
<br><br>
PERSONAL IDENTIFABLE INFORMATION
<br><br>
We and our third party service providers may use your PII and any third party PII that you may provide, as applicable:
<br><br>
to fulfill your requests, e.g., to allow you to order food through our restaurant partners and have it delivered to you or to provide you with information that you request.
<br>
to fulfill your purchases (e.g., to process credit card payments in connection with your food order).
<br>
to customize content on our Sites (e.g., the restaurants that will deliver to your location).
<br>
to send you important information regarding the Sites, such as certain changes to our terms, conditions, policies and/or other administrative information. Because this information may be material to your use of the Sites, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.
<br>
to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.
<br>
to permit you to send messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Sites. If you wish to use this feature, you may be required to provide us with, and we may use, your friend's email address to facilitate your sending of such message. By using this functionality, you affirm that you are entitled to use and provide us with your friend's name and email address for this purpose. We will not to use your friend's PII for any purpose other than to allow your message to be sent and/or to troubleshoot any issues with respect to the sending of your message, unless we disclose such other purpose to you at the time you provide your friend's PII to us.
<br>
to permit you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, "Promotions").
<br>
for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our website, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.
<br><br>
Security of Personal Information
<br>
NON-PERSONAL IDENTIFABLE INFORMATION (NPII)
<br><br>
Because your NPII does not personally identify you, we and our third party service providers may use such information for any purpose. For example, we work with third parties for the purpose of advertisement delivery on the Sites including online behavioral advertising (“OBA”) and multi-site advertising. The Non-PII collected about your visits to the Sites may be used by third parties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These third parties may also set cookies to assist with advertisement delivery services. If you would like to obtain more information about the practices of some of these third parties, or if you would like to make choices about their use of your information, please visit send us an email at service@metauniverse.ca
<br><br>
In addition, we reserve the right to share your NPII with our affiliates and with other third parties, for any purpose. In some instances, we and our third party service providers may combine Non-PII with PII. For example, on your personal profile page, we may display your user name (first name and last initial), member since date, total number of ratings and reviews, the ratings and reviews you have posted and their date(s) of posting, and the date range of when you last ordered from a particular restaurant. If we do combine any NPII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder (as long as it is so combined).
<br><br>
IP ADDRESS
<br><br>
We and our third party service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the Sites. Please note that we treat IP addresses, server log files and related information as Non-PII, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Accordingly, in general we may use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose PII.
<br><br>
We use best efforts to restrict third party usage of your PII for the limited purpose of fulfilling their contractual obligations with us. We also use best efforts to require that such information be destroyed at such time when our relationship with a third party is terminated, unless required for their records and auditing purposes, and then only what is necessary for such purposes may be retained.
<br><br>
From time to time we work with a third party that you have selected to interface with, and such third party retains the rights to the data that you voluntarily provide, which may contain your PII. In such cases, our rights to use information about you is limited, and where we do not own and control the data, it is more likely that your PII may be collected over time, and possibly used to track your online activities across websites. You should carefully read the Privacy Policies of any third party service provider who directs you to our Sites and services.
<br><br>
Forums and Profiles. We and our third party service providers may make available through the Sites certain services (for example, message boards, chat functionality, profile pages and blogs) to which you may be able to post information and materials. Please note that any information you provide in connection with such services may become public, and may be available to visitors to the Sites and to the general public, including without limitation the Ratings and Reviews that accompany many restaurant listings and the comments section of our blog posts. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your PII, and/or any other information and/or materials, on the Sites. NEITHER WE, NOR ANY OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, NOR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY DULY AUTHORIZED BY US AND/OR BY OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, IS OR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USE BY ANY UNAUTHORIZED PERSON OR ENTITY OF ANY PII YOU DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITES.
<br><br>
We recognize our legal obligations to protect personal information collected during the course of carrying on business. We have therefore made reasonable arrangements to secure against the unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or destruction of personal information. We use a third-party Payment company to securely process credit card transactions.
