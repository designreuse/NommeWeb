Whether you are looking for a quick salad and sandwich for lunch, or donuts and bagels every Friday; we have a service that fits your food delivery needs.

<strong>How do I know my order go through?</strong>
<br><br>
For mobile app device, when you complete the checkout process, our app will tell you that your order has been sent. You will also typically receive a notification message from us after your order has been confirmed by the restaurant. Our team takes it from there to make sure the restaurant receives your order. If you are using our website, you will also typically receive an email confirmation message from us after your order has been confirmed by the restaurant (though you need not wait for this email to know that your order has been sent). If there is any kind of problem with your order, we will attempt to contact you by telephone and/or email. Please make sure to always include a current telephone number where you can be reached, in case we need to contact you.
<br><br>
<strong>Can I revise/delete my order once it’s been placed?</strong>
<br><br>
Please contact the restaurant IMMEDIATELY and restaurant will do their best to help you with a revision or cancellation request. Sometimes they cannot be accommodated if the restaurant has already started to prepare your order. (In that scenario, we'd be happy to help you arrange to donate the food to a local shelter, if you are unable to put it to good use yourself).
