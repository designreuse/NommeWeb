Nomme is an online service that takes care of all your food
ordering needs, with features of food delivery, pick-up, and 
reservations. We provide a one way stop for your
convenience the next time you order from our long list of
local popular restaurants. Not only do we focus on your ordering satisfaction,
we also encourage your contribution to non-profit organizations
by giving donations on your behalf. 
<br><br>
As our partner restaurants, Nomme is able to process online 
orders for you in a organized environment and optimize the arrangements of 
human resources. Together, Nomme saves the cost of restaurant operations 
and shares the loss of unsuccessful orders. 
<br><br>
The Nomme App is available for IOS and Android.
